//        TIP:  Two Contact objects are equal if they have the same name.
//        TIP:  Be extremely careful about spaces in the printed message.
//        NOTE:  If you get an error from the Evaluate class, it's most likely the constructor. Check if you've added a constructor or if the constructor has the right arguments.
